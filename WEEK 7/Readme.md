EXAMPLE on EXTERNAL INTERRUPT:


-A pushbutton is connected to PD2 via external pull-down resistor

-A LED is connected to PB5 

-The LED will be turned ON only when the button is pressed.


EXAMPLE ON PIN CHANGE INTERRUPT:


-8 motion sensors are connected to the PORTD


EXAMPLE ON TIMER INTERRUPT:


-An LED that connected to PD5 will be flashed (1s ON and 1s OFF)

-Using timer2 overflow interrupt
