EXAMPLE 1:

-The program will print the value (0-1023) based on the serial based on the potentiometer.

EXAMPLE 2:

-The program will continuosly prints the value of PC3 on the serial.

-With these assumptions:

1.The clock speed of the microcontroller is 16MHz

2.The desired clock speed of ADC is 125 kHz

3.Use AVCC as analog reference

4.On-demand mode
